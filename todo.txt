Clockify viewing table looks weird

Payroll table seems to be what I have as clockify table. Will need to make a few tweaks to get to work
    going to skip clockify table and go directly into payroll. Then can set up the clockify view to 
    pull from payroll instead


Project/Activity List = ad-admin is normal work while vac/sick is vacation and sick which is different 
pay rates etc. These would have to be taken from the funds cash balance

I am still fuzzy on meaning of a range of dates. 
I think range of dates will be after the fact that I can have htmx do a query for entries with wanted dates.


Pay period -> activity -> fund -> employee
Each time one changes we can send request to view to get a new table with new totals
Each request should include the value for each dropdown to filter entries in the view
